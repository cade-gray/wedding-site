# Wedding Website

This was built for mine and my partner's wedding. View the site [here](https://wedding.cadegray.dev 'Our wedding website')
This can be used as a template for future wedding websites (with proper credit) if desired.
This is built using SvelteKit and interacts with an API that I built using expressjs which interacts with a mysql DB on planetscale.
A video explainging the process of building this will be made in the future and posted on my youtube channel.

## Developing

```bash

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
